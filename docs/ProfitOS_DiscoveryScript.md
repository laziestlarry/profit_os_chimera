# Discovery Call Script – Profit OS Growth Command Center

Use this as a guide, not a rigid script. Think of it as a **call flow**.

---

## 1. Opening & Framing (2–3 minutes)

**You:**
- "Thanks for hopping on. I'd love to understand how you're currently making growth decisions and whether a Profit OS is actually useful for you. The goal of this call:
  1. Map your key revenue streams & KPIs,
  2. See where decisions get stuck,
  3. Decide if a 2–4 week Profit OS Launch Sprint makes sense. Does that sound good?"

Confirm consent and expectations.

---

## 2. Quick Context Scan (5–10 minutes)

**Questions:**
- "Walk me through your main revenue streams."
- "Which channels matter most right now? (Shopify, SaaS, marketplaces, ads, content, etc.)"
- "What are the top 2–3 KPIs you look at weekly?"
- "Where do you feel the bottleneck is: traffic, conversion, retention, profitability?"

**Goal:** Spot where **data is present** but **decisions are fuzzy**.

---

## 3. How They Currently Decide (5–10 minutes)

**Questions:**
- "Who actually decides what experiments to run?"
- "How do you choose which ideas to prioritize?"
- "How do you know if an experiment 'worked'?"
- "Do you have a central place that links: metrics → ideas → actions → results?"

**Listen for:**
- Gut decisions without clear thresholds.
- Experiments with no evidence log.
- No unified view across channels.

---

## 4. Position Profit OS (3–5 minutes)

**You:**
- "Based on what you described, it sounds like you have [describe their situation in 1–2 sentences]. The Profit OS Growth Command Center is designed exactly for that gap."

**Short explanation:**
- "We connect/import your key metrics, define clear KPIs & thresholds, and install an AI-powered growth brain that:
  - Evaluates performance,
  - Suggests curated plays based on the numbers,
  - Turns them into a job queue for your team,
  - And logs evidence of what worked."

**Anchor on outcomes:** clarity, direction, execution, evidence.

---

## 5. Present the Launch Sprint (5–7 minutes)

**Outline your 3 steps, in their language:**
- "Week 1 – Data & KPIs: we map your funnels, define realistic KPI targets, and run the first diagnostic."
- "Week 2 – Plays & Architecture: we design your growth plays and set up the command center."
- "Weeks 3–4 – Experiments & Evidence: we run 1–3 high-impact plays and track the results."

**Optional:** ask which area they'd want to see a result in first (conversion, traffic, retention, etc.).

---

## 6. Handle Common Objections (5 minutes)

**If they say:**

**"We already have dashboards."**
- "Perfect. Profit OS doesn't replace them; it **sits on top** and turns your dashboards into decisions and job queues."

**"We don't have bandwidth."**
- "The sprint is designed to **reduce decision fatigue**, not add more. We agree on constraints up front and prioritize small, high-impact plays."

**"Is this AI safe/transparent?"**
- "Yes. Every play is tied to your metrics, explainable, and you approve changes. The system is a decision assistant, not an invisible autopilot."

---

## 7. Close with Clear Next Step (3–5 minutes)

**Options:**

**If strong fit:**
- "Based on this, I recommend a Profit OS Launch Sprint focused on [primary goal]. I'll send a short recap and proposal with scope + pricing. If you're happy, we can start with data mapping next week."

**If uncertain:**
- "Let me send you a 1-page summary and a sample output from a first cycle. You can see if that matches what you're looking for, and we'll reconnect in a few days."

**Always end with:**
- "What would a clear win in the next 60–90 days look like for you?"
- Reflect that back in your follow-up email.
