## Headline
Turn your scattered data into a **growth brain** that tells you **what to do next**.

## Subheadline
A 2–4 week sprint that installs a Chimera-style **AI growth command center** on top of your existing tools.

---

## The Problem

Most teams are:
- Drowning in dashboards but **starving for clear next steps**.
- Running ad-hoc experiments with no structure, no memory, and no proof.
- Unsure which levers actually move revenue, retention, or valuation.

**Result:** Slow decisions, scattered efforts, and a feeling that you're "busy" but not compounding.

---

## The Solution: Profit OS Growth Command Center

A **BI + operations + growth** system that:

1. Ingests your key metrics (revenue, funnels, traffic, CAC, retention, NPS).
2. Evaluates performance against clear KPI targets and thresholds.
3. Triggers curated growth plays based on your actual numbers.
4. Orchestrates a job queue for your team/automations.
5. Logs evidence to show what worked (or didn't) and why.

**You don't just get charts. You get a living growth brain for your business.**

---

## Who It's For

- Digital commerce brands (Shopify / DTC / marketplaces).
- SaaS & productized services with multiple channels and funnels.
- Agencies who want a repeatable, white-label growth OS for clients.

**You should already have:**
- Some traction (revenue + traffic).
- Tools in place (analytics, CRM, platforms).
- Desire to move beyond "random hacks" to **systematic growth**.

---

## How It Works (3-Step Sprint)

**Step 1 – Data & KPI Map**
We map your revenue streams and funnels, define critical KPIs and thresholds, and connect/import your key metrics.

**Step 2 – Plays & Command Center**
We design a tailored library of **growth plays** (acquisition, conversion, retention, pricing) and set up your command center: KPIs, plays, agents, evidence logging.

**Step 3 – Run Plays & Capture Evidence**
We run 1–3 priority plays, monitor metrics, and log evidence: what moved, by how much, and what to repeat or kill.

---

## What You Get

- Custom KPI map (revenue, conversion, retention, CAC, loyalty).
- Playbook engine with **trigger → play → job plan** definitions.
- Roles & agents map (who owns which metrics and actions).
- A running instance of your **Profit OS engine** (scripts + processes).
- A simple dashboard view of:
  - KPIs & health status.
  - Recommended plays.
  - Evidence log (before/after for each major move).
- A short **Operating Manual** for your team:
  - How to read the command center.
  - How to approve and prioritize plays.
  - How to run weekly/monthly growth cycles.

---

## Expected Outcomes (First 30–60 Days)

- A unified view of your growth levers and bottlenecks.
- 1–3 **evidence-backed improvements** (conversion, traffic, retention, or efficiency).
- A reusable "growth OS" that turns each new idea into a structured experiment.

---

## Engagement & Investment (Indicative)

- **Profit OS Launch Sprint (2–4 weeks)**
  - Fixed fee based on complexity.
  - Includes setup, config, and first experiment cycle.

- **Ongoing Co-Pilot (optional)**
  - Monthly support to run cycles, refine plays, and interpret evidence.

Exact pricing is finalized after a brief discovery call based on your scale and stack.

## Next Step

If this sounds like the missing "growth brain" for your business:

**Book a short discovery call** – We'll map your current streams, define what "success in 90 days" looks like, and see if Profit OS is a fit.

(For now, you can just reply/DM "Profit OS" and we'll schedule.)
